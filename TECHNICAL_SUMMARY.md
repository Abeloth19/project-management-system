### Technology Stack Rationale

#### Backend: Django + GraphQL
**Why Django:**
- Rapid development with built-in admin, ORM, and authentication
- Mature ecosystem with extensive documentation
- Excellent support for complex business logic and validation
- Strong multi-tenancy patterns

**Why GraphQL over REST:**
- Single endpoint reduces API surface area
- Client-driven data fetching (no over/under-fetching)
- Strong type system with introspection
- Real-time subscriptions capability (future)
- Better developer experience with GraphiQL

#### Frontend: React + TypeScript
**Why React:**
- Component-based architecture for reusability
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Excellent developer tools and debugging
- Strong performance with virtual DOM

**Why TypeScript:**
- Compile-time error detection
- Better IDE support and autocomplete
- Self-documenting code through types
- Easier refactoring and maintenance

#### Database: PostgreSQL
**Why PostgreSQL:**
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Excellent JSON support for flexible schemas
- Advanced indexing capabilities
- Proven scalability and performance

## 🎯 Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Multi-Tenancy Strategy

**Decision**: Organization-based row-level tenancy
```python
# Every query includes organization filter
projects = Project.objects.filter(organization__slug=org_slug)
```

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Schema-per-tenant: Too complex for this scale
- Database-per-tenant: Overkill for requirements
- Shared everything: No data isolation

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Simple implementation and maintenance
- ✅ Cost-effective for small to medium scale
- ✅ Easy to backup and manage
- ❌ Requires careful query filtering
- ❌ Potential for data leakage if misconfigured

### 2. API Design: GraphQL Schema-First

**Decision**: Single GraphQL endpoint with type-safe schema
```graphql
type Query {
  projects(organizationSlug: String!): [Project!]!
  tasks(organizationSlug: String!, projectId: ID): [Task!]!
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Reduces API complexity from multiple REST endpoints
- Client decides what data to fetch
- Strong typing prevents runtime errors
- Excellent tooling (GraphiQL, Apollo DevTools)

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Single source of truth for API
- ✅ Reduced network requests
- ✅ Type safety across full stack
- ❌ Learning curve for team members
- ❌ Potential for complex queries

### 3. Frontend State Management

**Decision**: Apollo Client for GraphQL state + React state for UI
```typescript
// GraphQL state
const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GET_PROJECTS);

// Local UI state
const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);
```

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Redux: Too complex for current needs
- Zustand: Good, but Apollo already handles global state
- Context API: Would duplicate Apollo's functionality

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Automatic caching and synchronization
- ✅ Optimistic updates for better UX
- ✅ Built-in loading and error states
- ✅ Query deduplication and batching

### 4. Task Status Workflow

**Decision**: Finite state machine with validation
```python
valid_transitions = {
    'TODO': ['IN_PROGRESS', 'BLOCKED'],
    'IN_PROGRESS': ['DONE', 'BLOCKED', 'TODO'],
    'BLOCKED': ['TODO'],
    'DONE': []  # Final state
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Prevents invalid state transitions
- Enforces business rules at data layer
- Clear workflow for users
- Audit trail of status changes

### 5. Component Architecture

**Decision**: Feature-based organization with shared UI components
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/           # Shared UI primitives
│   ├── projects/     # Project-specific components
│   └── tasks/        # Task-specific components
├── pages/            # Route-level components
├── hooks/            # Custom hooks
└── utils/            # Utility functions
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Reusable UI components
- ✅ Easy to locate and modify code
- ✅ Scalable structure

## 🔄 Data Flow Architecture

### Request Flow
```
User Action → React Component → Apollo Client → GraphQL → Django → PostgreSQL
     ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓        ↓         ↓
UI Update ← State Update ← Cache Update ← Response ← Business Logic ← Data
```

### Multi-Tenancy Flow
```
1. User selects organization
2. Organization slug stored in URL/state
3. All GraphQL queries include organizationSlug parameter
4. Backend filters all data by organization
5. Response contains only organization-specific data
```

## ⚖️ Trade-offs Made

### 1. Simplicity vs. Features

**Chosen**: Simplicity
- No real-time updates (WebSockets)
- No advanced permissions (role-based access)
- No file uploads
- No audit logging

**Rationale**: Focus on core functionality and clean implementation over feature breadth.

### 2. Performance vs. Development Speed

**Chosen**: Development speed with good performance practices
- Apollo Client caching instead of custom caching
- Database indexes on common query patterns
- Debounced search instead of complex search engine
- Simple pagination instead of cursor-based

### 3. Type Safety vs. Flexibility

**Chosen**: Type safety
- Full TypeScript implementation
- GraphQL schema validation
- Django model validation
- Compile-time error detection

### 4. Bundle Size vs. Developer Experience

**Chosen**: Developer experience
- Full Apollo Client (larger bundle)
- Tailwind CSS (larger initial CSS)
- Multiple UI libraries for comprehensive components

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### Backend Optimizations
```python
# Database indexes for common queries
class Meta:
    indexes = [
        models.Index(fields=['project', 'status']),
        models.Index(fields=['organization', 'created_at']),
    ]

# Query optimization with select_related
projects = Project.objects.select_related('organization').prefetch_related('tasks')
```

### Frontend Optimizations
```typescript
// Debounced search to reduce API calls
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setDebouncedSearch(searchTerm);
  }, 300);
  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [searchTerm]);

// Apollo Client caching
const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache: new InMemoryCache({
    typePolicies: {
      Query: {
        fields: {
          projects: relayStylePagination(),
        },
      },
    },
  }),
});
```

### Database Optimizations
- Proper indexing on foreign keys and filtered fields
- Connection pooling with PostgreSQL
- Query analysis and optimization

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Data Isolation
```python
# Every model query includes organization filter
def get_projects(info, organization_slug, **kwargs):
    return Project.objects.filter(
        organization__slug=organization_slug,
        organization__is_active=True
    )
```

### Input Validation
```python
# Django model validation
def clean(self):
    if self.due_date and self.due_date < timezone.now():
        raise ValidationError('Due date cannot be in the past')
```

### Frontend Security
- XSS prevention through React's automatic escaping
- CSRF protection via Django middleware
- Input sanitization and validation

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Backend Testing
```python
# Model tests
class TaskModelTest(TestCase):
    def test_status_transitions(self):
        # Test valid and invalid status changes
        
# GraphQL tests  
class GraphQLQueryTests(TestCase):
    def test_organization_isolation(self):
        # Verify data isolation between organizations
```

### Test Coverage
- **Models**: 33 tests covering validation and business logic
- **GraphQL**: 20 tests covering queries, mutations, and permissions
- **Integration**: Multi-tenancy isolation verification

### Testing Philosophy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
